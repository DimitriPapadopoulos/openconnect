# Problem description

1. I ran openconnect-gp as follows: `openconnect --protocol=gp <!-- Show other command line options here -->`
2. 
3.

# Operating system and openconnect-gp version

openconnect-gp version:

```
    <!-- Run "openconnect --version" and include the output here -->
```

operating system

```
    <!-- Run "uname -a" and include the output here -->
```

# GlobalProtect VPN information

```
<!--
    Run openconnect with the highest verbosity, and dump all HTTP traffic:
    
       openconnect --dump-http-traffic -vvvv 
       
    Compare its output with the anonymized GlobalProtect VPN connection flow shown here:
    
       https://gist.github.com/dlenski/5046e5f934ac111e8d8718fc10c25703

    Include as much of the HTTP traffic as you can here. Don't forget to anonymize sensitive
    information, especially:
       - username
       - password
       - authcookie
       - ESP keys
       - external IP addresses
-->
```
